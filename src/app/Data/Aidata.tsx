    <h2 class="text-white mb-4 fw-bold">Mastering Cursor: Expert Techniques for Faster Development</h2>

    <p>
      Cursor is a powerful AI-first code editor designed to accelerate development. While core features like Chat, Ask, and Agent mode are intuitive, maximizing its potential requires adopting effective workflows and understanding its nuances. This guide provides expert techniques and best practices to leverage Cursor efficiently, avoid pitfalls, and boost productivity in coding and test automation.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">Core Philosophy: AI as a Collaborator, Not an Autopilot</h3>
    <p>
      The most effective way to use Cursor is as an intelligent pair programmer. It can draft code, refactor, debug, and find information, but human guidance, context, and verification are essential. Blindly accepting AI suggestions can introduce subtle bugs or inefficient code. The goal is augmentation, not abdication.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">1. Prioritize "Ask" (@ Mentions) Over Agent Mode</h3>
    <p>
      Use targeted 'Ask' commands for precise, controlled results. Agent mode handles multi-step tasks well, but 'Ask' ensures changes are focused and predictable.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Modifying specific functions, adding docstrings, or writing unit tests for a file.</li>
      <li><strong>Method:</strong> Select code or use <code>@</code> mentions for files, symbols, or docs, then give clear instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Why:</strong> Narrows context and reduces unintended changes across the codebase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">2. Commit Often, Revert Fearlessly</h3>
    <p>
      AI may misinterpret instructions or generate errors. Frequent commits and discarding incorrect changes allow iterative, safe progress.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Workflow:</strong> Commit work before starting AI tasks, give focused instructions, review changes, and commit or discard as needed.</li>
      <li>Safe checkpoints speed up iteration and reduce debugging time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">3. Maximize Context Awareness</h3>
    <p>
      Cursor performs best when provided rich, relevant context. Open related files, select code snippets, use <code>@</code> mentions, and explain <em>why</em> changes are needed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Open Files:</strong> Keep related files visible.</li>
      <li><strong>Code Selection:</strong> Focus AI on specific blocks.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear Instructions:</strong> Explain intent, not just actions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">4. Watch for Misapplied Changes & Hallucinations</h3>
    <p>
      AI can apply correct code in the wrong location or invent nonexistent functions. Always verify diffs and code references before accepting suggestions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Check Location & Correctness:</strong> Use diff view to confirm changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Confirm suggested functions/imports exist in the codebase or libraries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">5. Leverage Incremental Guidance</h3>
    <p>
      Break large tasks into smaller steps. Guiding Cursor incrementally improves accuracy and maintainability instead of generating large code blocks in one go.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">6. Document and Reuse Patterns</h3>
    <p>
      Capture successful prompts and strategies. Reusing proven approaches for similar tasks enhances speed, consistency, and overall productivity.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4 fw-bold text-white">Happy coding with Cursor — maximize AI, maintain control, and accelerate your workflow!</p>

    <h2 class="text-white mb-4 fw-bold">Generate Perfect Bug Tickets in Seconds with AI</h2>

    <p>
      Clear, concise, and consistent bug reports are crucial for efficient software development. Writing them manually can be slow and error-prone. This guide shows how to leverage AI tools like ChatGPT, along with screenshots and narrated screen recordings, to produce high-quality bug documentation in a fraction of the usual time.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">The Hidden Cost of Poor Bug Reports</h3>
    <p>
      Vague tickets such as “it doesn’t work” force developers to hunt for clues, reproduce issues blindly, or bounce tickets back to QA. Multiply that across a sprint and you lose days. AI-assisted reporting eliminates this friction by standardizing rich bug descriptions from the start.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Less back-and-forth:</strong> Developers receive all critical details upfront.</li>
      <li><strong>Faster triage:</strong> Clear severity, environment, and reproduction steps enable immediate prioritization.</li>
      <li><strong>Higher fix rate:</strong> Fewer tickets are closed as “Cannot Reproduce”.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">1. Screenshot-to-Description: Turning Pixels into Precision</h3>
    <p>
      Screenshots capture visual bugs, but words matter. LLMs excel at converting screenshots into developer-ready narratives that clearly describe the issue.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a clear screenshot highlighting the defect.</li>
      <li>Paste the image or a short description into ChatGPT.</li>
      <li>Add context such as URL, browser, and viewport size.</li>
      <li>Request an Observed Result and Expected Result in one paragraph each.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Prompt example:</strong></p>
    <pre>“You are a QA engineer. The screenshot shows the avatar overlapping the header.
Write the Observed Result (1 sentence) and the Expected Result (1 sentence).”</pre>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">2. Voice Narration-to-Ticket: Speak, Don’t Type</h3>
    <p>
      Some bugs involve complex sequences. Record your screen with narration, transcribe the audio, and let AI structure it into a formal ticket.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use Loom, OBS, or QuickTime to capture video and audio.</li>
      <li>Transcribe the narration using Whisper, Otter, or auto-caption tools.</li>
      <li>Feed the transcript to ChatGPT with a short instruction for formatting.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Prompt example:</strong></p>
    <pre>“Format the transcript into a bug report with:
• Title (max 12 words)
• Steps to Reproduce (numbered)
• Observed Result
• Expected Result
• Environment
Transcript:
---
&lt;paste transcript&gt;
---”</pre>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">3. Customizable Formatting: Match Your Team’s Canon</h3>
    <p>
      AI can mimic your team’s ticket template. Show one example and instruct the model to follow it, whether it’s Gherkin, Markdown, or a custom macro.
    </p>
    <pre>“In future responses follow <u>exactly</u> this outline:
# Summary
## Steps to Reproduce
## Observed Result
## Expected Result
## Environment
## Severity (Critical/Major/Minor)
Generate the bug report now.”</pre>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">4. Boosting Consistency across the Entire Pipeline</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Query severity vs. component reliably.</li>
      <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Trigger CI jobs or auto-labels predictably.</li>
      <li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> New QA hires ramp up faster with consistent examples.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">5. Prompt-Engineering Cheat-Sheet</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Who:</strong> Target audience (e.g., senior frontend developer).</li>
      <li><strong>What:</strong> Required format or skeleton.</li>
      <li><strong>Where:</strong> Location of bug (route, OS, device).</li>
      <li><strong>When:</strong> Observation context (build number, commit hash).</li>
      <li><strong>Why:</strong> Impact or severity guidance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-white mb-4 fw-bold">Become a 3x QA Engineer with AI Augmentation</h2>

    <p>
      Unlock significant productivity gains in your QA workflows by leveraging AI. This guide explores practical strategies using tools like Cursor to analyze code, generate tests, debug efficiently, and amplify your impact as a QA Engineer.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">1. Deep Code Understanding for Smarter Testing</h3>
    <p>
      Stop spending hours deciphering complex codebases. Use AI to quickly grasp functionality, identify critical paths, and pinpoint potential edge cases.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chat with your Codebase:</strong> Ask Cursor questions like "Explain the user authentication flow in \`auth.ts\`" or "Where is the payment processing logic handled?" Get concise explanations and navigate directly to relevant code sections.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate Code Summaries:</strong> Select a complex function or module and ask Cursor to summarize its purpose, inputs, outputs, and dependencies. Accelerates test planning and risk assessment.</li>
      <li><strong>Identify Related Code:</strong> Use Cursor to find all usages of a specific function or component, helping understand potential impacts and design comprehensive tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">2. Accelerated Test Case Generation</h3>
    <p>
      Move beyond manual test case design. Leverage AI to automatically generate relevant test scenarios based on code or requirements.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Generate Unit Tests:</strong> Point Cursor to a function and ask it to generate unit tests covering various scenarios, including edge cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate Integration Test Outlines:</strong> Describe a user flow and ask Cursor to outline integration steps with potential assertions.</li>
      <li><strong>Test Cases from Requirements:</strong> Paste requirements or user stories and ask Cursor to generate corresponding test cases or BDD scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">3. Faster Debugging of Test Failures</h3>
    <p>
      Reduce the time diagnosing failing tests. AI can analyze errors, stack traces, and code to suggest potential causes and fixes.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Explain Errors:</strong> Paste cryptic error messages or stack traces into Cursor and get plain-English explanations.</li>
      <li><strong>Suggest Fixes:</strong> Provide failing test and relevant app code, and ask Cursor to identify potential bugs or fixes.</li>
      <li><strong>Analyze Logs:</strong> Feed application or test logs to Cursor to identify patterns or pinpoint failure sources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">4. Automated \`data-testid\` Insertion for Stable E2E Tests</h3>
    <p>
      Ensure robust end-to-end tests. Let AI intelligently add stable \`data-testid\` attributes to UI elements.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Identify Elements Lacking Selectors:</strong> Scan component files to locate interactive elements missing stable test selectors.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate \`data-testid\` Attributes:</strong> Instruct Cursor to add meaningful \`data-testid\` attributes, e.g., \`data-testid="login-submit-button"\`.</li>
      <li><strong>Refactor Tests to Use \`data-testid\`:</strong> Update existing E2E tests to rely on these stable selectors instead of fragile CSS or XPath paths.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-white mt-5">5. Enhanced Test Documentation & Reporting</h3>
    <p>
      Streamline the creation of test plans, summaries, and bug reports.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Generate Test Summaries:</strong> Provide Cursor with test files and get a summary of the covered functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Draft Bug Reports:</strong> Describe a bug, provide reproduction steps, and include code or logs; Cursor drafts structured bug reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Explain Test Code:</strong> Ask Cursor to add comments or generate documentation explaining complex test logic.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4 fw-bold text-white">
      By integrating these AI-augmented workflows, you can reduce manual effort, improve test quality, and focus on higher-value QA activities. Start experimenting with Cursor daily and unlock your potential as a 3x QA Engineer!
